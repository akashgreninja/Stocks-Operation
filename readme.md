<h2>Trading App</h2>

<p>This is a simple trading app that matches buy and sell orders for a given stock symbol. It uses the Alpha Vantage API to fetch stock data and executes trades based on the current market price.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<h4>fetchStockData(symbol)</h4>

<p>This function fetches stock data for a given symbol from the Alpha Vantage API. It returns the response data as a JSON object.</p>

<h4>executeTrade(buyOrder, sellOrder)</h4>

<p>This function executes a trade between a buy order and a sell order. It deducts the transaction cost from the buyer's balance and adjusts the quantity of the orders accordingly. It also logs the trade details and the transaction cost using the Winston module.</p>

<h4>matchOrders()</h4>

<p>This function matches buy and sell orders based on their price. It loops through the buy and sell orders and executes trades for any matching orders.</p>

<h3>Winston Module</h3>

<p>The Winston module is used for logging in the trading app. It allows us to log messages at different levels (e.g., info, error) and to write the logs to different transports (e.g., file, console). In this app, we use a file transport to write the logs to a file called trading-app.log.</p>

<h3>Scaling using Dockerization</h3>

<p>Dockerization is a way to package an application and its dependencies into a container that can be run on any system. This makes it easy to deploy and scale the application across multiple servers. To scale the trading app using Dockerization, we can create a Docker image of the app and deploy it to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.</p>

<h3>Scaling using Amazon AWS</h3>

<p>Amazon AWS provides a number of services for scaling applications, including Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, and Amazon ECS. Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the app, while Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand. Amazon ECS is a container orchestration service that allows us to deploy and manage Docker containers at scale. By using these services, we can easily scale the trading app to handle large amounts of traffic.</p>

<h2>Multi-stage Dockerization</h2>

<p>Multi-stage Dockerization is a technique that allows you to use multiple Docker images in a single Dockerfile. This technique is useful for building and deploying applications that have multiple dependencies and require different environments for development and production.</p>

<p>The main benefit of multi-stage Dockerization is that it allows you to reduce the size of the final Docker image by separating the build environment from the production environment. In the build stage, you can use a larger image that includes all the necessary build tools and dependencies, while in the production stage, you can use a smaller image that only includes the necessary components to run the application.</p>

<p>By using multi-stage Dockerization, you can reduce the size of the final Docker image, which can improve performance and reduce the time it takes to deploy the application.</p>

<h2>Distroless Images</h2>

<p>Distroless images are Docker images that are stripped down to only include the necessary components to run a specific application. These images are designed to be lightweight and secure, as they do not include any unnecessary components or dependencies.</p>

<p>The main benefit of using distroless images is that they can improve the security and performance of your application. By removing unnecessary components and dependencies, you can reduce the attack surface of your application and improve its overall security. Additionally, distroless images are typically smaller than traditional Docker images, which can improve performance and reduce the time it takes to deploy the application.</p>

<p>Overall, multi-stage Dockerization and distroless images are good practices to follow when building and deploying Dockerized applications. By using these techniques, you can improve the security, performance, and efficiency of your application, while also reducing the size of the final Docker image.</p>
